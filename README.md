# Car_Sales_Database_Management_System-Database-Solution
Data Source
-----------
- We have used car sales data to build this project. We utilized "faker" package in python to mock the data for our use case. Initially before BCNF normalization we created the data for 6 tables and later these tables are normalized using BCNF to decompose them into 9 tables.

- The script used to generate the "data_gen.ipynb" is added to this project module for further reference.

Creating Tables
---------------
- The SQL queries used to create the tables are added to this project module and is named "create.sql".

- The web app is hosted on public cloud and the URL to the web page is https://cse-560-dmql-proj-rangers.streamlit.app/ and the same is mentioned in the project report.

- The code for the web page "app.py" is included in the project module.

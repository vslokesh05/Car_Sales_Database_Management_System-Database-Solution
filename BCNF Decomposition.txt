1. customers
	a. customer_id --> name, email, phone_number
	b. email --> name
	c. phone_number --> name
2. customer_address
	a. customer_id --> address, city, state, zipcode
	b. address, city, state --> zipcode (Not in BCNF)
	c. zipcode --> state (Not in BCNF)
	This FD is not in BCNF. Thus we need to decompose this.
	Closure of {zipcode}
		{zipcode}+ = {zipcode, state}
		Split the table into 2 relations {zipcode, state} and {zipcode, address, city, customer_id}. This is in BCNF since {customer_id} and {address, city} are keys for the relation.
3. vehicles
	a. vehicle_id --> type, make, model, year, vin, availability, customer_id
	b. vin --> type, make, model, year
	c. model --> make (Not in BCNF)
	This FD is not in BCNF. Thus we need to decompose this.
	Closure of {model} is:
		{model}+ = {model, make}. The key is {model}.
		Split this relation into 2 relation {model, make}, {type, model, year, vin, availability, customer_id, vehicle_id}. This is in BCNF.
4. vehicle_details
	a. vehicle_id --> miles_used, color, engine_type, transmission_type, fuel_type, number_of_seats
	b. engine_type --> fuel_type (Not in BCNF)
	Closure of {engine_type} is:
		{engine_type}+ = {engine_type, fuel_type}.
		Split this relation into 2 relations {engine_type, fuel_type} and {engine_type, vehicle_id, miles_used, color, transmission_type, number_of_seats}. This is in BCNF.
5. sales
	a. sale_id --> vehicle_id, customer_id, sale_date, sale_price
	b. vehicle_id --> customer_id, sale_date, sale_price
6. price_history
	a. vehicle_id, price_recorded_date --> price.
